  <h5 style="font-size: 28px; color:#053568;">  Follow the below tips to prevent Stroke Disease before it's too late!  </h5>

  <br>
  <h5 style="color:#053568;">1. Lower blood pressure</h5>

  <p style="font-size: 19px;color: #7A8FA4">
    High blood pressure is a huge factor, doubling or even quadrupling your stroke risk 
    if it is not controlled. High blood pressure is the biggest contributor 
    to the risk of stroke in both men and women. Monitoring blood pressure and, if it is elevated, treating it, is probably the biggest difference people can make to their vascular health.

  <br> 

  <h5 style="color:#053568;"> 2. Lose weight</h5>

  <p style="font-size: 19px;color: #7A8FA4">

    Obesity, as well as the complications linked to it 
    (including high blood pressure and diabetes), raises your 
    odds of having a stroke. If you're overweight, losing as 
    little as 10 pounds can have a real 
    impact on your stroke risk.

  </p>

    <br>
   <h5 style="color:#053568;">3. Eat a heart-healthy diet</h5>

   <p style="font-size: 19px;color: #7A8FA4">
    A healthy diet can help protect your Body, improve your blood
     pressure and cholesterol, and reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes. A heart-healthy eating plan includes: <br> <br>
     - Vegetables and fruits <br>
     - Beans or other legumes <br>
     - Lean meats and fish <br>
     - Low-fat or fat-free dairy foods <br>
     - Whole grains <br>
     - Healthy fats, such as olive oil <br> <br> 

     Two examples of heart-healthy food plans include the Dietary Approaches to
      Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and the Mediterranean diet.

      Limit intake of the following: <br> <br>
      
      - Salt <br>
      - Sugar <br>
      - Processed carbohydrates <br>
      - Alcohol <br>
      - Saturated fat (found in red meat and full-fat dairy products) and trans fat (found in fried fast food, chips)


   </p>
   <br>

   <h5 style="color:#053568;">4. Maintain a healthy weight</h5>

   <p style="font-size: 19px;color: #7A8FA4">Stay at a healthy weight for you. Lose weight if youâ€™re overweight or obese. Start by eating fewer calories and moving more.
    You can check your body mass index (BMI). If you need help, talk to your health care team about a weight loss plan.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h5 style="color:#053568;">5. Get good quality sleep</h5>

  <p style="font-size: 19px;color: #7A8FA4">
    A lack of sleep can do more than leave you yawning; it can harm your health. People who don't get enough sleep have a 
    higher risk of obesity, high blood pressure, Stroke attack, diabetes and depression. <br> <br>

    Most adults need at least seven hours of sleep each night. Make sleep a priority in your life. Set a sleep schedule and stick to it by 
    going to bed and waking up at the same times each day. 
    Keep your bedroom dark and quiet, so it's easier to sleep. <br> <br>

    If you feel like you've been getting enough sleep but you're still tired throughout the day, ask your doctor if you
    need to be evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that can increase your risk of Stroke <br> <br>

    Signs of obstructive sleep apnea include loud snoring, stopping breathing for short times during sleep and waking up
   gasping for air. 
  Treatments for obstructive sleep apnea may include losing weight if you're overweight or using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device that keeps your airway open while you sleep.
 </p>
  <br>
 <h5 style="color:#053568;">6. Manage stress</h5>
 <p style="font-size: 19px;color: #7A8FA4">
  Some people cope with stress in unhealthy ways
   such as overeating, drinking or smoking. Finding alternative ways to manage stress 
   such as physical activity, relaxation exercises or meditation can help improve your health.
 </p>
 <br>
 <h5 style="color:#053568;">7. Get regular health screenings</h5>

 <p style="font-size: 19px;color: #7A8FA4">
  High blood pressure and high cholesterol can damage your heart and blood vessels. But without testing for them, you probably won't know 
  whether you have these conditions. Regular screening can tell you what your numbers are and whether you need to take action.
  <br> <br>
  Blood pressure : Regular blood pressure screenings usually start in childhood. Starting at age 18, your blood pressure should be measured at least once every two years to screen for high blood pressure as a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.

  If you're between 18 and 39 and have risk factors for high blood pressure, you'll likely 
  be screened once a year. People age 40 and older also are given a blood pressure test annually. <br> <br>

  Cholesterol levels: Adults generally have their cholesterol measured at least once every four to six years. Cholesterol screening
   usually starts at age 20, though
   earlier testing may be recommended if you have other risk factors, such as a family history of early-onset Stroke. <br> <br>

   Type 2 diabetes screening : Diabetes is a risk factor for heart disease. If you have risk factors for diabetes, such as being overweight
    or having a family history of diabetes, your doctor may recommend early screening. If your weight is normal and you don't 
   have other risk factors for type 2 diabetes, screening is recommended beginning at age 45, with retesting every three years.
